# Rich-Text-Editor
Web App with an HTML Rich Text Editor

This code is for Google Apps Script.  You must have a Google account to create an Apps Script file, and run the Web App.

Most of the code is from Mozilla.org

This Apps Script Web App is totally self contained.  I doesn't need any external dependencies.  If you are familiar with Apps Script, then you will know what to do with the files.

There are only two types of files inside of an Apps Script project, HTML and Script files.  All CSS and JavaScript files are in HTML files.  Script (.gs) files run on Google's servers.

To import this file from GitHub to your Apps Script code editor, you can use the
Apps Script GitHub Assistant

Or you can copy and paste if you want.
